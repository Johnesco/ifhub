Fever Dream
A Perceptual Horror by Anonymous
Release 1 / Serial number 260301 / Inform 7 v10.1.2 / D


You wake on a cold floor. Your head aches. You do not remember arriving.

The air smells of iodine and old paper.

Receiving Room
Fluorescent tubes buzz overhead, one of them flickering at the edge of failure. A long counter divides the room -- scuffed linoleum on your side, dark wood on the other. The only door leads east, into a corridor.

A yellowed form lies on the counter.

A pair of wire-rimmed spectacles sits beside the form.

>Taken.

>You put on the spectacles.

>
Corridor
A long hallway tiled in white, though several tiles have cracked and not been replaced. The gaps show raw concrete beneath. The Receiving Room lies west. East, a treatment room door stands ajar.

Between the cracked tiles, a seam runs the width of the floor -- too straight to be structural damage. It outlines a trapdoor. A recessed handle sits flush with the tile.

>
Stairwell
Concrete steps descend to a landing where the air turns cold and damp. Pipes run along the ceiling, sweating condensation. The trapdoor above opens back to the corridor. A passage continues south into a laboratory.

Scratched into the underside of one pipe, visible only from this angle: a row of tally marks. You count thirty-seven.

A pipe wrench lies on the bottom step, half-hidden by shadow.

>Taken.

>
Laboratory
A long room lined with workbenches and glass-fronted cabinets. Everything is labelled. Everything is in order. The labels are handwritten in the same careful script as the intake form upstairs. A passage leads north to the stairwell. East, a heavy door opens into cold storage.

One of the glass cases, mounted on the far wall, holds something you missed before: a brass key, suspended on a wire inside the glass.


>SFX:glassYou swing the wrench. The glass shatters cleanly. The brass key drops into your hand.

>
Cold Storage
The temperature drops the moment you cross the threshold. Your breath fogs. Racks of specimen jars line the walls, their contents suspended in amber fluid. A heavy metal cabinet stands against the far wall, marked with a snowflake symbol.

The laboratory is back to the west.

The amber fluid in the jars is moving. Not flowing -- twitching, as if the things inside are not entirely preserved.

A heavy metal cabinet stands against the far wall, locked tight.

>The key turns smoothly. The lock disengages with a click that echoes longer than it should.

>Taken.

>It tastes of nothing. Then of everything. The walls ripple once and settle into new shapes. You understand, now, that this is not distortion. This is clarity.

The world has not changed. Your ability to see it has.

>
Laboratory

>Where the floor was solid before, a wound has opened -- a vertical shaft lined in something wet and muscular. You descend.

Cistern
The chamber is alive. The bricks are teeth in a circular jaw. The dark water below is a throat, swallowing and unswallowing in slow rhythm. The pipes overhead are arteries, pulsing with something that is not water.

An iron valve grows from the north wall like a bone spur. Beside it, a sign hangs from the flesh of the wall.

The passage back up is to the west.


A hiss from the cracked pipes overhead. Something cold and chemical settles on your skin, your eyes, your tongue. You blink. The letters on the sign shift. The walls flicker like a signal losing coherence.

When your vision steadies, the world has not returned to normal. It has gone further.

>You grip the handle and turn it left. Metal screams against metal. Below, the dark water begins to move -- circling, spiraling, draining. The level drops and keeps dropping until only a slick of pale residue remains on the bricks.

The drainage grate in the floor stands open now, revealing a narrow passage below.

>You lower yourself through the grate.
