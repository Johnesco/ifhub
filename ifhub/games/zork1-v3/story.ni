Chapter 14 - Gate/Bolt Interaction

Instead of turning the bolt:
	if the player does not carry the wrench:
		say "The bolt won't turn with your best effort.";
	otherwise if the gate-flag is false:
		say "The bolt won't turn with your best effort.";
	otherwise if the gates-open is true:
		now the gates-open is false;
		now the reservoir-fill-timer is 8;
		say "The sluice gates close and water starts to collect behind the dam.";
	otherwise:
		now the gates-open is true;
		now the reservoir-empty-timer is 8;
		say "The sluice gates open and water pours through the dam."

The reservoir-fill-timer is a number that varies. The reservoir-fill-timer is 0.
The reservoir-empty-timer is a number that varies. The reservoir-empty-timer is 0.

Every turn when the reservoir-empty-timer > 0 (this is the reservoir emptying rule):
	decrease the reservoir-empty-timer by 1;
	if the reservoir-empty-timer is 0:
		now the low-tide is true;
		now the trunk of jewels is zil-visible;
		if the player is in Dam-Room:
			say "The water level behind the dam is now quite low.";
		if the player is in Deep Canyon:
			say "The roar of rushing water is quieter now.";
		if the player is in Reservoir-South or the player is in Reservoir-North:
			say "The water level is now quite low here and you could easily cross over to the other side.";
		if the player is in the magic boat and the location of the player is Reservoir:
			say "The water level has dropped to the point at which the boat can no longer stay afloat. It sinks into the mud."

Every turn when the reservoir-fill-timer > 0 (this is the reservoir filling rule):
	decrease the reservoir-fill-timer by 1;
	if the reservoir-fill-timer is 0:
		now the low-tide is false;
		now the trunk of jewels is zil-invisible;
		if the location of the player is Reservoir:
			if the player is in the magic boat:
				say "The boat lifts gently out of the mud and is now floating on the reservoir.";
			otherwise:
				die saying "You are lifted up by the rising river! You try to swim, but the currents are too strong. You come closer, closer to the awesome structure of Flood Control Dam #3. The dam beckons to you. The roar of the water nearly deafens you, but you remain conscious as you tumble over the dam toward your certain doom among the rocks at its base.";
		if the player is in Dam-Room:
			say "The water level behind the dam is now quite high.";
		if the player is in Deep Canyon:
			say "A sound, like that of flowing water, starts to come from below.";
		if the player is in Reservoir-South or the player is in Reservoir-North:
			say "You notice that the water level has risen to the point that it is impossible to cross."

Every turn when the location of the player is Reservoir and the player is not in the magic boat and the reservoir-fill-timer > 0 and the low-tide is true (this is the reservoir perilous warning rule):
	say "You notice that the water level here is rising rapidly. The currents are also becoming stronger. Staying here seems quite perilous!"
